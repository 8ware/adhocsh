adhocsh - An ad-hoc shell for subcommand-based CLI programs
===========================================================

Are you tired of always typing `git`? Do you curse 'cause `systemctl` is awful
to enter? Then this is for you! Start an ad-hoc shell and use subcommands as
first level commands.

See `recipes/` for some examples.

```
$ recipes/gitsh
Ad-hoc shell for git.
